        "Material is the metaphor."
        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="string1">Do the blind people always need acute supervision? \t  Blind people are far more aware of their environment and have more mastery than they are given credit for. They may need inputs just like anyone else, to familiarize themselves in a new place or learn a new technology. But, visually impaired people by no means are perpetually dependent on others for their living. I would urge you to approach all visually impaired people with this in mind – If they need assistance, trust that they will ask for it on their own.</string>
    <string name="string2">Visual impairment does not equate with complete loss of vision. In fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15.88% of people who are visually impaired, face total darkness or are blind. The remaining 84.12% have partial or residual vision, like color perception, light perception, movement or even form perception. They may be able to see in blurs or varying degrees of distortion, with literal blind spots in some areas. As you can see, there are many ways of having low vision, and it is not a binary between sight and darkness.</string>
    <string name="string3">Many blind people report perceiving their visual impairment as a mere physical challenge. By no means do they see it as debilitating or the end of their joy. And they don’t believe that ‘being’ blind is their identity. This group of people is as powerful, magnificent and capable as anybody else. And the onus on making a much-needed attitudinal shift lies with the rest of us. So, the next time you find yourself thinking “Oh poor thing, s/he is blind”, check yourself and explore how you can change some deep-rooted assumptions that play out when interacting with people who have different abilities.</string>
    <string name="string4">Some visually impaired people I know, often wish that everyone else would just treat them as people, and not as people with a condition. Unsolicited and extra assistance is something that may make them feel small. For example, helping them cross the road and taking them to their destination, when they just ask for directions. Or buying groceries for them and counting money on their behalf. Even picking up something they dropped and taking over carrying their stuff, are all considered as overcompensating kindness, which many blind people report as derogatory. Ask if they need help. Accept it if they say no.</string>
    <string name="string5">Popular culture depicts that if one of the senses of a person stops working, the others become sharper. This is not necessarily true! Though blind people may rely more on their other senses, and develop a strong memory or are tuned into auditory cues, they may not always have a sixth sense. However, there is evidence that suggests blind people use a process called ‘echolocation’, whereby sound waves are used to determine the location and size of objects within a particular area. Dr. Gavin Buckingham says, “They will either snap their fingers or click their tongue to bounce sound waves off objects, a skill often associated with bats, which use echolocation when flying.</string>
    <string name="string6">You don’t have to hold yourself back from using vision-oriented language with them, like look, see, watch, witness or even viewpoint! They do not take offense at such words, and might actually feel awkward if they sense you making a conscious effort to avoid such terms. Instead, just let them be a part of your experience, as they make you a part of theirs. After all, blindness is not a stigma.</string>
    <string name="string7">Yes. People with blindness like exploring new places, go to the movies, music concerts, try out new restaurants and even indulge in adventure sports like racing, snowboarding, trekking, skydiving etc. They as excited or hindered by their surroundings, as anybody else. This predisposition primarily depends on the personality types of individuals. Some are introverted and prefer their alone time or controlled environments. Others are extraverted and proactively seek varied experience.</string>
    <string name="string8">Their dreams show up just the way they experience daily life- with a rich mix of sensory cues. In a Danish study (2014) of 50 blind adults, 18% of the blind participants (both congenital and later-onset) reported tasting in at least one dream, compared with 7% of sighted participants. Nearly 30% of the blind reported smelling in at least one dream. Almost 70% reported a touch sensation and 86% hearing. However, the emotions and themes of their dreams are known to be similar to that of people with sight.</string>
    <string name="string9">Some individuals who develop blindness later in life, relate to colors just like people with sight. For others who haven’t experienced color as intricately, relate to it through association and building concepts like the fire is yellow or the sky is blue. They also associate it with energy forms: blue=cold, white=frozen, red=hot. Sometimes s/he can only tell bright colors or they might have a hard time telling blue or black or brown apart, or pink from white. Whatever is the case, colors have meaning for all people and the blind understand the concept.</string>
    <string name="string10">Since there are varying degrees of visual impairment and blindness, some individuals seek assistance in the form of white canes or red tips canes which denote degree of impairment. Many others prefer using guide dogs, who are trained to help them navigate through curbs, doors or crosswalks. They keep an eye on their owner’s right shoulder to protect against collisions.</string>
    <string name="string11">You may not know how to be with people who are blind, or might want to understand them better. Thus, it is perfectly fine for you to ask them about their lives and how their experiences are. The key here is to be curious, have a willingness to learn and appreciate the uniqueness that comes with being visually impaired. As said earlier, many blind people don’t see their situation as limiting, and can offer great insights, if you just ask.</string>
    <string name="string12">Psychologists say that success in life, education and jobs of visually impaired individuals are directly proportional to the expectations that people around have of them, and the degree of positive attitudes they encounter. The more capable and able you believe they are, the more they will shine. Self-esteem, self-belief and self-image are partially formed through social interactions, and it is important that people encounter empowering experiences. Be that experience!  As you allow this understanding to settle, just remember that blindness is not a defect or a stigma. It is a characteristic, just as sight is, and Helen Keller’s words capture this fact beautifully: “I can see, and that is why I can be happy, in what you call the dark, but which to me is golden. I can see a God-made world, not a manmade world.”</string>
    <string name="string13">1)- Address people who are blind or have low vision by their names so they know you are speaking to them.  2)- Do not walk away from a person who is blind or have low vision without indicating that you are doing so - it is embarrassing and frustrating to talk to thin air.   3)- In dangerous situations say \"STOP\" rather than \"LOOK OUT\".  4)- Use ordinary language when directing or describing and be specific. Do not point, or say \"over there\". Direct people who are blind or have low vision to their left and right, not yours.  5)- Use words like \"look\" and \"see\"; they are part of everyone\'s vocabulary. Otherwise both you and the person who is blind or have low vision will feel awkward.  6)- Be aware that the person who is blind or has low vision will be disadvantaged by not seeing what is going on. Therefore, talk about what is happening.  7)- If people who are blind or have low vision extend their hands to shake, do so.</string>
    <string name="string14">1)- Describe the surroundings and obstacles in a person\'s pathway (remember to look up as well as down). Warn of the presence of over-hangs, such as kitchen cupboards, jutting side mirrors of cars, or trees.  2)- Do not leave doors ajar. Close them or open them fully.  3)- Ask people who are blind or have low vision what they want or need. Do not direct questions through their companion.  4)- When seating people who are blind or have low vision, put their hands on the back of the chair and they will then be able to seat themselves.  5)- Do not fill glasses or cups to the brim.  6)- Do not relocate objects or furniture without telling the person who is blind or has low vision.</string>
    <string name="string15">Be respectful, above all else. Someone who has a disability should be afforded the same amount of respect as anyone else. View others as people, not impairments. Focus on the person at hand and her individual personality. If you must put a \"label\" on the disability, it\'s best to ask what terminology she prefers and stick with the terms she chooses. In general, you should follow the “golden rule”: treat others as you would like to be treated. Many, but not all, people with disabilities prefer \"people first\" language, which puts the name or person before the disability. For example, you would say “his sister, who has Down syndrome” rather than “his Down\'s sister\". More examples of appropriate people first language include, \"Robert has cerebral palsy,\" \"Leslie is partially sighted,\" or \"Sarah uses a wheelchair,\" rather than saying someone \"is mentally/physically challenged/handicapped\" (both of which are often seen as patronizing terms) or referring to \"the blind girl\" or \"the girl in the wheelchair.\" If possible, avoid these blanket terms when referring to people. While some people find the word \"disabled\" unpleasant, others use it to describe themselves because they feel erased by treating it like a \"bad word\", and their disability is part of who they are. Take your lead from the person you are interacting with. If they refer to themselves as \"disabled\", ask if they are comfortable being described that way or why they choose to describe themselves like this. It will help you gain insight into their perspective. It\'s worth noting that labeling norms vary a great deal between people and groups. In particular, many deaf, blind, and autistic individuals have rejected people-first language and prefer \"identify-first\" language (for example, \"Anisha is autistic\"). As another example, it\'s common within the deaf world to see the terms deaf or hard of hearing used to describe their disability, but the term Deaf (with an uppercase D) to refer to their culture or someone who is part of it. If in doubt, just politely ask the individual you\'re talking to what they prefer.</string>
    <string name="string16">Never talk down to someone with a disability. Regardless of being their abilities, no one wants to be treated like a child or patronized. When you’re speaking to someone with a disability, don’t use childlike vocabulary, pet names, or a louder-than-average talking voice. Do not use patronizing gestures such as patting her on the back or head. These habits communicate that you don’t think the person with a disability is capable of understanding you and that you equate her to a child. Use a regular speaking voice and vocabulary, and talk to her just like you would talk to someone without a disability. It is appropriate to slow down your speech for someone who is hard of hearing or has a cognitive disability. Equally, it may be acceptable to talk to people who have hearing loss in a louder than average voice, so that they are able to hear you. Usually, someone will mention it to you if you are speaking too quietly. [6] You may also ask whether you are speaking too quickly, or ask her to tell you if you need to slow down or speak more clearly if necessary. Don’t feel like you have to reduce your vocabulary to the most basic words. The only time you may be asked to simplify your language, is if you are talking to someone who has a severe intellectual or communication difficulty. Baffling your conversational partner is unlikely to be viewed as good mannered and neither is talking at somebody who is unable to follow what you are talking about. However, if in doubt, speak casually and ask about their language needs.</string>

    <string name="string22">Disability: Appropriate: person with a disability. Inappropriate: impaired; crippled; handicap; handicapped person; or the handicapped. Likewise, use of well-intended but awkward terms such as special need, challenged, handicapable, differently abled, and, handiabled assumes that the person is uncomfortable with their own disability, and it gives the impression that the user of the term is uncomfortable around a person who has a disability. Disability is a general term used for functional limitation that interferes with a person’s ability to walk, hear, or learn, for example. It may refer to a physical, mental, or sensory condition.  People with disabilities: Appropriate: people with cerebral palsy; people with spinal cord injuries. Inappropriate: the disabled; the cerebral palsied; the spinal cord injured. People should be referred to as people first. Never identify people solely by their disability.   Person who has a disability: Appropriate: person who has multiple sclerosis. Inappropriate: afflicted with, or suffers from, multiple sclerosis. Most people with disabilities do not regard themselves as suffering continually; they do not view their disability as an affliction.   Person who was born with a disability: Appropriate: person with a physical disability; person with no arms. Inappropriate: lame; defective; defect; deformed; invalid; infirmed; vegetable. Such words are offensive, dehumanizing, degrading, and stigmatizing.    Person who incurred a disability: Appropriate: person who incurred a spinal cord injury; person who has post-polio syndrome; person who had a stroke. Inappropriate: victim of a spinal cord injury; stricken with polio; victim of a stroke. People with disabilities do not like to be perceived as victims for the rest of their lives.   Deaf or hard of hearing: Appropriate: person who is deaf; person who is hard of hearing; person with hearing loss. Because of their shared historical and cultural experience, members of this community also consider it acceptable to say deaf person; the deaf; or the deaf community. Inappropriate: hearing impaired; deaf and dumb. The inability to speak does not indicate lack of intelligence. Deafness often refers to a person who has a total loss of hearing. People who are deaf are sometimes able to speak and speech read (i.e. lipread), despite profound hearing loss.   Blind or Low Vision: Appropriate: person who is blind; person who has low vision. Because of their shared historical and cultural experience, members of this community also consider it acceptable to say blind person, or the blind. Inappropriate: visually handicapped; visually impaired. Many blind individuals have some light perception or partial vision. Some people who are blind read and write using Braille as their primary form of written language. People with low vision have a range of visual acuity, with some individuals being able to read large print material. Many people who are blind or who have low vision use assistive technology such as screen readers and screen magnification software to interact with computers and other electronic devices.      Speech disability: Appropriate: person with a speech disability; person who stutters; communication disability. Inappropriate: speech impaired; halted; dumb; mute. For someone who is unable to speak, the appropriate terms are person who is non-verbal; person who is unable to speak; person without speech. Some people who are non-verbal use augmentative and alternative communication devices, or different forms of sign language, to communicate.   Mobility disability: Appropriate: person who uses a wheelchair or crutches; a wheelchair user; walks with crutches. Inappropriate: confined/restricted to a wheelchair; wheelchair bound, physically impaired. Most people who use a wheelchair or mobility device do not regard it as confining. In fact, it becomes an extension of the person and it is viewed as liberating.   Intellectual disability: Appropriate: person who has an intellectual disability; person who has a cognitive disability; person who incurred a traumatic brain injury. Inappropriate: mentally retarded; the retarded; mentally impaired; feeble minded; moron; imbecile; idiot. These terms are offensive to people who bear the label as well as family and friends of those individuals. Developmental disabilities are a broader category of disabilities that arise during childhood or youth, which may include intellectual disabilities.   Mental Illness: Appropriate: person with a mental health condition; person with a psychiatric disability; person with a behavioral health disability. Inappropriate: crazy; freak; maniac; lunatic; psycho. People with mental health conditions are one of the most stigmatized groups due to a long history of discrimination, the misconception that the individual should be able to easily manage the illness, and the misconception that mental illness is associated with violent behavior.   Short stature: Appropriate: person of short stature; little person. Inappropriate: deformed; dwarf; midget. The term little person is one of few exceptions to the notion of placing the term “person” first in our communications.   Recovering from a health condition: Appropriate: person recovering from a stroke; a cancer or brain injury survivor. Inappropriate: brain injured; brain damaged; victim of a stroke.   No disability: Appropriate: person who does not have a disability; person without a disability; person who is able to walk, see, hear, etc.; Inappropriate: healthy person or normal person, when used to contrast with a person who has a disability. The term “healthy” implies that the person with a disability is unhealthy. Many people with disabilities have excellent health. Likewise, use of “normal person” implies that the person with a disability is abnormal. No one wants to be labeled as abnormal.</string>
